# Enhanced Entity and Relationship Extraction Summary

## Overview

Successfully enhanced the `_extract_entities_and_relations` method in the Neo4j Knowledge Graph Manager to use multiple extraction techniques: **LLM-based extraction**, **semantic search extraction**, and **rule-based extraction**. This multi-method approach significantly improves the accuracy and comprehensiveness of entity and relationship extraction from text.

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Multi-Method Extraction Pipeline**

The enhanced `_extract_entities_and_relations` method now combines three extraction approaches:

```python
def _extract_entities_and_relations(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract entities and relationships from text using multiple methods"""
    entities = []
    relationships = []
    
    # Method 1: LLM-based extraction (if available)
    if hasattr(self.llm, 'predict') and not isinstance(self.llm, type(self._create_dummy_llm())):
        try:
            llm_results = self._llm_based_extraction(text)
            entities.extend(llm_results.get('entities', []))
            relationships.extend(llm_results.get('relationships', []))
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"LLM extraction failed: {e}")
    
    # Method 2: Semantic search-based extraction
    try:
        semantic_results = self._semantic_search_extraction(text)
        entities.extend(semantic_results.get('entities', []))
        relationships.extend(semantic_results.get('relationships', []))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Semantic search extraction failed: {e}")
    
    # Method 3: Rule-based extraction (fallback)
    rule_results = self._rule_based_extraction(text)
    entities.extend(rule_results.get('entities', []))
    relationships.extend(rule_results.get('relationships', []))
    
    # Remove duplicates
    entities = self._deduplicate_entities(entities)
    relationships = self._deduplicate_relationships(relationships)
    
    return {"entities": entities, "relationships": relationships}
```

### 2. **LLM-Based Extraction** (`_llm_based_extraction`)

**Features:**
- Uses OpenAI GPT or other LLM models for intelligent extraction
- Structured JSON prompt for consistent output
- Focuses on people, organizations, locations, job titles, skills, and technologies
- Extracts complex relationships using natural language understanding

**Prompt Structure:**
```python
prompt = f"""
Extract entities and relationships from the following text. 
Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "entities": [
        {{
            "name": "entity name",
            "type": "person|organization|location|job_title|skill|technology",
            "description": "brief description"
        }}
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {{
            "source": "source entity name",
            "target": "target entity name", 
            "type": "relationship type (e.g., works_at, reports_to, located_in, has_skill)",
            "description": "brief description of the relationship"
        }}
    ]
}}

Text to analyze: {text}
"""
```

### 3. **Semantic Search Extraction** (`_semantic_search_extraction`)

**Features:**
- **spaCy Integration**: Uses spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) for entity detection
- **Dependency Parsing**: Extracts relationships using syntactic dependency analysis
- **Semantic Patterns**: Advanced regex patterns for relationship detection
- **Fallback Support**: Basic semantic extraction when spaCy is unavailable

**Components:**

#### a) **spaCy NER Integration**
```python
def _semantic_search_extraction(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        doc = nlp(text)
        
        # Extract named entities
        for ent in doc.ents:
            entity_type = self._map_spacy_entity_type(ent.label_)
            entities.append({
                "name": ent.text,
                "type": entity_type,
                "description": f"{entity_type} mentioned in text"
            })
        
        # Extract relationships using dependency parsing
        relationships.extend(self._extract_dependency_relationships(doc))
        
        # Extract relationships using semantic patterns
        relationships.extend(self._extract_semantic_patterns(text))
        
    except OSError:
        return self._basic_semantic_extraction(text)
```

#### b) **Dependency Parsing**
```python
def _extract_dependency_relationships(self, doc) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Extract relationships using dependency parsing"""
    for token in doc:
        # Look for subject-verb-object patterns
        if token.dep_ == "nsubj" and token.head.pos_ == "VERB":
            subject = token.text
            verb = token.head.text
            obj = None
            
            # Find object
            for child in token.head.children:
                if child.dep_ in ["dobj", "pobj"]:
                    obj = child.text
                    break
            
            if obj:
                rel_type = self._map_verb_to_relationship(verb)
                if rel_type:
                    relationships.append({
                        "source": subject,
                        "target": obj,
                        "type": rel_type,
                        "description": f"{subject} {verb} {obj}"
                    })
```

#### c) **Semantic Pattern Matching**
```python
def _extract_semantic_patterns(self, text: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Extract relationships using semantic patterns"""
    patterns = [
        # Employment patterns
        (r'(\w+) (?:works at|is employed by|is at|joined) (\w+)', 'works_at'),
        (r'(\w+) (?:reports to|works for|is managed by) (\w+)', 'reports_to'),
        (r'(\w+) (?:manages|leads|supervises) (\w+)', 'manages'),
        
        # Role patterns
        (r'(\w+) is a (\w+(?:\s+\w+)*)', 'has_job_title'),
        (r'(\w+) serves as (\w+(?:\s+\w+)*)', 'has_job_title'),
        
        # Location patterns
        (r'(\w+) (?:lives in|is located in|is from|resides in) (\w+)', 'located_in'),
        
        # Collaboration patterns
        (r'(\w+) (?:collaborates with|works with|partners with) (\w+)', 'collaborates_with'),
        
        # Skill patterns
        (r'(\w+) (?:knows|is skilled in|expert in|specializes in) (\w+)', 'has_skill'),
        (r'(\w+) (?:uses|works with|develops) (\w+)', 'uses_technology'),
    ]
```

### 4. **Basic Semantic Extraction** (`_basic_semantic_extraction`)

**Fallback Method:**
- Advanced regex patterns for entity detection
- Person name patterns (First Last, Dr. First Last, etc.)
- Organization patterns (Company Inc, Corp, LLC, etc.)
- Job title patterns with seniority levels
- Relationship pattern matching

### 5. **Deduplication and Cleanup**

#### a) **Entity Deduplication**
```python
def _deduplicate_entities(self, entities: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Remove duplicate entities based on name"""
    seen = set()
    unique_entities = []
    
    for entity in entities:
        name = entity.get('name', '').lower().strip()
        if name and name not in seen:
            seen.add(name)
            unique_entities.append(entity)
    
    return unique_entities
```

#### b) **Relationship Deduplication**
```python
def _deduplicate_relationships(self, relationships: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Remove duplicate relationships based on source, target, and type"""
    seen = set()
    unique_relationships = []
    
    for rel in relationships:
        key = (
            rel.get('source', '').lower().strip(),
            rel.get('target', '').lower().strip(),
            rel.get('type', '').lower().strip()
        )
        if all(key) and key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            unique_relationships.append(rel)
    
    return unique_relationships
```
